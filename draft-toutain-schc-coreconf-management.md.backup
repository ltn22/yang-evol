--- abstract

This document describe how CORECONF management can be applied to SCHC Context. 


--- middle

# Introduction{#intro}

{{RFC9363}} defines the YANG Data Model for a SCHC context (a.k.a Set of Rules). {{I-D.ietf-lpwan-architecture}} proposes the architecture for rule management. Some rules must be clearly dedicated to the modification of the context.

{{RFC9254}} defines a way to serialize data issued from a YANG DM into a CBOR representation and {{I-D.ietf-core-comi}} defines the CoAP interface.

This document describes in which condition management can be done, how to manage rules inside an SCHC instance using CORECONF and proposes some compression rules for the protocol headers.

# Applicability statement

## Architecture

SCHC instance management allows the two end-points to modify the common SoR, by:

* modifyng rules values (such as TV, MO or CDA) in existing rules
* adding a new rule or 
* removing an existing rules. 

The rule management uses the CORECONF interface {{I-D.ietf-core-comi}} based on CoAP. The management traffic is carried as SCHC compressed packets tagged to some specific rule IDs. They are identified as M rules in Figure {{Fig-SCHCManagement}}.  M Rules can be either Compression rules or No compression rules. Only M rules can modify the SoR.


SCHC Packets using M Rules MUST be encrypted either by the underlying layer (for instance in a QUIC stream dedicated to managenement inside a QUIC connection) or directly using OSCORE of DTLS.

## CoAP Profile

Management requests MUST be protected against packet losts. It is RECOMMENDED to use CONfirmable requests and no Token. If the management request is too large regarding the MTU, SCHC Fragmentation SHOULD be used instead of the Block option.

## Rule modification

SCHC imposes that both ends share exactly the same SoR, therefore, a new or modified rule cannot be used while it remains in candidate status until the other end has validated the modification.
A candidate rule cannot be used, either in C/D or F/R. A SCHC PDU MUST NOT be generated with a candidate rule ID and received PDUs containing a candidate rule ID must be dropped.

{: #Fig-Rule-mod title='Modifying a rule'}


{{Fig-Rule-mod}} illustrates a Rule modification. The left-hand side entity A wants to make rule x evolve.  It send and acknowledged CoAP message to the other end. 
A change the status of the rule to candidate, indicating that the rule cannot be used anymore for SCHC procedures. The receiving entity B, acknowledge the message,
and contiue to maintain the rule candidate for a guard period. At the reception of the acknowledgement, A set also a guard period before rule x becomes valid again.

The guard period is used to avoid SCHC message with a rule ID to appear at the other end after a rule modification. The Guard period appears only once during the rule management and is depends on the out-of-sequence messages expected between both ends.

## Rule creation 

Rule creation do not require a guard period, and acknowledgment is RECOMMENDED. Figure {{Fig-Rule-creation}} gives an example, where the Acknowledgment is lost.
Entity A sends a management message to create a new rule. Since its a new rule, the guard period is not set and the new rule becomes immediatly valid on B. 
The Acknowledgement does not reach back A, so the rule stays in the candidate state, but the reception of a SCHC PDU carrying the RulE ID X, informs that the
message has been correctly received by B. So X becomes valid in A.

## Rule deletion

After the rule deletion, a Guard period is established. During that period, a rule with the same ID cannot be created, and SCHC PDU corrying the Rule ID are dropped.

# Management messages

## YANG Data Model
CORECONF proposes an interface to manage data structured with a YANG Data Model. RFC 9363 defines a YANG Data Model for SCHC Rules. 
SCHC Instance Management MUST use FETCH to read a rule and iPATCH to create, modify or delete a rule.
In order to accomplish management, the YANG Data Model has been updated. 

### Nature Management
M Rules have to be marked in a way that allows quickly identifying which rules in a SoR are responsible for management. 
Therefore, a new "nature-management" type has been defined. This nature is actually a specialization of "nature-compression" for management purposes and compression needs to be available and activated to do management.

### Guard
To determine if a rule is considered available or not during the guard period, a rule needs to have a status which determines if it can be used. Basically, an available rule MUST associate the key "rule-status" with the value "status-active".
Conversely, during the guard period, "rule-status" MUST be set to "status-candidate".

### YANG tree representation
The YANG tree represents the Rule structure as defined in RFC 9363 with the two updates described above:

{: #Fig-tree title='Updated YANG Data Model for CORECONF'}


## Set of Rules Editing
For clarity reasons, this document will use YANG Identifiers in quotes instead of the SID values.
In the YANG tree, all the lines of the tree have a SID number. Each level of the hierarchy is accessible through one or several keys. For example, to access the hierarchy under "rule", "rule-id-value" and "rule-id-length" must be specified. To access the hierarchy describing an entry in a compression rule, "rule-id-value" and "rule-id-length" must be followed by "field-id", "field-position" and "direction-indicator". Since the TV, MO-value and CDA-value are stored as lists, "index" must be added to access a specific element.

Therefore, to access a specific element in a hierarchy, the SID of this element has to be specified, followed by the keys needed to access it.

For example, `["target-value/value", 5, 3, "fid-ipv6-version", 1, "di-bidirectional", 0]` is used to access the first value (0) of TV for the IPv6 Version of Rule 5/3.

### FETCH
As mentionned in {{I-D.ietf-core-comi}}, FETCH request helps to retrieve at least one instance-value.

Example : Fetching TV, MO and CDA of the Entry fid-ipv6-version/1/bidirectional from Rule 6/3.

~~~
REQ: FETCH /c
     (Content-Format: application/yang-identifiers+cbor-seq)
["target-value",       6, 3, "fid-ipv6-version", 1, "di-bidirectional"],
["matching-operator",  6, 3, "fid-ipv6-version", 1, "di-bidirectional"],
["comp-decomp-action", 6, 3, "fid-ipv6-version", 1, "di-bidirectional"]

RES: 2.05 Content
     (Content-Format: application/yang-instances+cbor-seq)
{
  {"target-value"       : [{"index" : 0, "value" : h"06"}]},
  {"matching-operator"  : "mo-equal"},
  {"comp-decomp-action" : "cda-not-sent"}
}
~~~

### iPATCH
<<<<<<< HEAD
To write an iPATCH request, several methods could be used. For instance, in a Rule 7/8, an entry for a field was set to ignore/value-sent and the target-value was not set, these following commands specify a new TV and change the MO and CDA :

- Specified all conserned fields :

  ~~~
  iPATCH /c 
  {
    ["target-value", 7, 8, field, 1, "di-bidirectional"] : [{delta_TV: 0, delta_value: value}],
    ["matching-operator", 7, 8, field, 1, "bi-directional"] : "mo-equal",
    ["comp-decomp-action", 7, 8, field, 1, "bi-directional"] : "cda-not-sent"
  }
  ~~~

- This can also be specified in a single entry, by setting the sub-tree:

  ~~~
  iPATCH /c 
  {
    ["entry", 7, 8, field, 1, "di-bidirectional"] : { 
        delta_target-value       : [{delta_index : 0, delta_value : value}],
        delta_matching-operator  : "mo-equal",
        delta_comp-decomp-action : "cda-not-sent"

    }
}
~~~

The same principle is applied to rules and "leaf-list".

#### Add
If the target object doesn't exist in the context, then it is appended. 
It supports three main cases:
* Adding a new key-value pair to an existing object
* Adding a new object to an existing list

One important specification is that for every leaf-list, the YANG Data Model describes that every index should be incremental. In CORECONF, we trust the user/system.

Example:
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Add TV into fid-ipv6-payload-length/1/di-bidirectional in Rule 0/3

        {delta_index : 1, delta_value : h"55"}
    ]
  }
  
  RES: 2.04 Changed

#### Update
A request can be considered as an update if the target associated with the various keys is present in the context. Otherwise, it could be consider as an add or an error.

Additionally, while updates are authorized, deleting a protected key is forbidden.

### Optimization

This process imposes to send the full rule in the value part, so an optimization can be done by deriving an exisiting rule and modify some parameters. 

{{I-D.toutain-schc-universal-option}} augments the data model for universal options. This add to compression rules a new entry format where a field is indexed with:
* a space-id, a YANG identifier refering to the protocol containing options (CoAP, QUIC, TCP,...)
* the option used in the protocol
* the position

## RPC

Represented as a tree:

~~~
  rpcs:
    +---x duplicate-rule
       +---w input
       |  +---w from
       |  |  +---w rule-id-value?    uint32
       |  |  +---w rule-id-length?   uint8

       |     +---w rule-id-length?   uint8

After duplication, the new rule stays in a candidate state until the new values are set. 

# Protocol Stack

The management inside the instance has its own IPv6 stack totally independant of the rest of the system. The goal is to implement IPv6/UDP/CoAP to allow the implementation of the CORECONF interface. No other kind of traffic is allowed.

The end-point acting as a Device has the IPv6 address fe80::1/64 and the other end fe80::2/64. 

Both implements CoAP client and server capabilities. The server uses port 5683 and the client 3865. 

## Compression Rules

Two rules are required for management functionality. The first rule (RuleID M1) defines packets containing application payloads that include a CoAP Content-Format field. Depending on the direction (Up or Down), this rule manages Confirmable FETCH/iPATCH requests or Non-Confirmable Content responses accordingly. Therefore, the second rule (RuleID M2) is used to compress packets which do not include application payload, basically response packets in downlink.
